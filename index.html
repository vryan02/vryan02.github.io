<h1>What I contributed:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Legend of Zelda Unity Remaster</li>
    <ul>
        <li>For the original zelda level we remade, I worked on enemy mechanics, the boomerang, bow, bow room, link's grid-based movement, as well as the text in the old-man room.</li>
    <li>For our new custom level & mechanic, I worked on the pets, mechanics to switch levels & switch between pets, as well as many of our bug fixed for p1_gold</li>
    </ul>
    <li>SporeShroom</li>
    <ul>
        <li>For this project, I did the entirety of the coding, including the teleportation mechanic, level hierarchies, level design, and more. The concept was my own. The music & sprites were outsourced.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h1>Technology used for both</h1>
